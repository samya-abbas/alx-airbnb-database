# üìà Airbnb Clone ‚Äì Database Index Optimization

This task focuses on improving the performance of SQL queries in the Airbnb Clone backend by identifying and creating indexes on frequently used columns across the database.

---

## üéØ Objective

To optimize the execution time of complex queries by creating indexes on columns that are frequently used in:
- `JOIN` conditions
- `WHERE` clauses
- `ORDER BY` operations

---

## üß± Targeted Tables and Columns

Based on query patterns from earlier tasks (joins, filtering, aggregations), the following columns were selected for indexing:

| Table     | Column          | Reason for Indexing                            |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `users`   | `user_id`        | Used in JOINs and filtering                    |
| `users`   | `email`          | Used in authentication queries (WHERE clause) |
| `bookings`| `user_id`        | Used in JOINs and filtering                    |
| `bookings`| `property_id`    | JOINed with `properties`                      |
| `properties` | `host_id`     | JOINed with `users` (hosts)                   |
| `reviews` | `property_id`    | Frequently joined or filtered                 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Index Creation (Defined in `database_index.sql`)

Sample `CREATE INDEX` commands:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_id ON bookings(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_host_id ON properties(host_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_property_id ON reviews(property_id);
