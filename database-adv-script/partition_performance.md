# 📊 Booking Table Partitioning – Performance Report

## 🎯 Objective
Optimize query performance on a large `bookings` table by implementing table partitioning based on `start_date`.

---

## 🧱 Partitioning Strategy
We used **PostgreSQL range partitioning** to split the `bookings` table by quarter:

- `bookings_2025_q1`: Jan–Mar
- `bookings_2025_q2`: Apr–Jun
- `bookings_2025_q3`: Jul–Sep
- `bookings_2025_q4`: Oct–Dec

This ensures that queries filtering by date range only scan the relevant partition.

## ⚙️ Performance Testing

### 🔍 Test Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings_partitioned
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-06-30';
🧪 Before Partitioning
Table scanned: Entire bookings

Strategy: Sequential scan

Rows scanned: ~50,000+

Execution time: ~230ms

✅ After Partitioning
Partition scanned: Only bookings_2025_q2

Strategy: Index scan (on partition)

Rows scanned: ~12,000

Execution time: ~45ms

✅ Conclusion
Partitioning dramatically reduced the number of rows scanned and improved performance by over 5x for date-filtered queries. This technique is ideal for large datasets where queries often target ranges.
