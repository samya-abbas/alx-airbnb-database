# ðŸ“„  README â€” `join_queries.sql`

## 1.â€¯Purpose
`join_queries.sql` is a small, selfâ€‘contained script that demonstrates three critical SQLâ€‘join patterns against the **ALXâ€¯Airbnb** sample schema:

1. **INNERÂ JOIN** â€” list bookings with the user who made each booking.  
2. **LEFTÂ JOIN** â€” list every property, together with any reviews (NULL if none).  
3. **FULLÂ OUTERÂ JOIN** â€” return every user and every booking, even when a match is missing (implemented with a UNION workaround for MySQL).

These queries are useful for learners who want to verify their understanding of join semantics while working with a realistic Airbnbâ€‘style database.

## 2.â€¯Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **MySQL**   |Â 8.0+    | The script uses JSON and window functions available from 8.0. <br/>If youâ€™re on PostgreSQL, the queries run unmodified except for the FULLÂ OUTER workaround (PostgreSQL supports it natively). |
| **Schema**  |Â Tables: `users`, `properties`, `bookings`, `reviews` | Defined in the projectâ€™s `schema.sql`. |

# Load database credentials from your shell
export DB="airbnb_clone"
export DBUSER="samya"
export DBPASS="secret"

# Execute the joins
mysql -u $DBUSER -p$DBPASS $DB < join_queries.sql
